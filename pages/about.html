        Hi, I'm Mark, a passionate web developer with 7 years of professional
        experience. I specialize in building websites using HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and WordPress. Over the years, I've mastered working with
        popular tools like Elementor and a wide variety of WordPress plugins to
        create fully customized, high-performing websites tailored to each
        client's needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus is on crafting clean, responsive, and visually engaging
        designs that not only look great but also deliver seamless user
        experiences. Whether it's creating a site from scratch or enhancing an
        existing one, I bring creativity, technical skill, and dedication to
        every project I work on.
